# Compute

Delphi.Compute library, inspired by Boost.Compute.

Under development!

The goal is to provide a high-level interface to GPGPU programming
through OpenCL, so one can easily utilize the powers of modern 
GPU/APUs in Delphi.


## Example

```Pascal
  // Add one to each element in input data and take the square root
  output_data := Compute.Transform(input_data, sqrt(_1 + 1));
```


## Running the code
Since this project relies on OpenCL, please make sure you have
OpenCL platform drivers installed.
